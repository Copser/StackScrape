# StackScrape
Python project for WebScraping Stackoverflow.

I have made a Web Scraper for scraping the Stackoverflow new posted question. It is wery simple crawler which use:
Python Scrapy, SQLAclhemy, pycopg2.

If you want you can clone the repository and try it your self. You just need to change the code in settings.py.
This scraper is loading data into the PostgreSQL database, so you need to define your password and username for 
PostgreSQL database.

Thank you.
